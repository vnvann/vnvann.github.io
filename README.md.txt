# vnvann.github.io
Valencia vnvann@my.waketech.edu
My Git hub account owner is  vnvann and the repository name is vnvann.github.io
The file was created as public and a readme file was selected. 
To clone the repository on my local computer after creating the account I opened Git hub desktop. At the top of the screen I selected the repository that I wanted to clone from the menu in the left hand corner under current repository. I then selected file in the top left menu items and chose clone repository at which a screen opened up and and ask me to select a repository and selected choose. Under the choose option I was provided my local machine folders and I chose documents left click to create a new folder named it Gitclone double click and selected clone at the botton. I forgot to add there are a few options at the top of the clone a repository screen and the one selected is GITHUB.com and I didnt alter this.
